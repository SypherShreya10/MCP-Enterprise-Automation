About the oddo container description in the infra_notes.md:
1️⃣ Odoo Application Container
What this means
This section answers one question:
“What is Odoo allowed to do in this system?”
Your answers say:
Odoo is the brain
It owns business logic
It talks to the database
Humans interact with it via port 8069
AI does not

Why this matters
Later, when someone asks:
“Why can’t the agent just create records directly?”
“Why not bypass Odoo and write SQL?”
You point here and say:
“Because Odoo is the only writer of business data.”

This prevents:
data corruption
broken workflows
orphaned records
silent inconsistencies
This section establishes authority.
